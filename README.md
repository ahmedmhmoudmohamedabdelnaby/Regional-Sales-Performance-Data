Regional Sales Performance Data
Sales Data Analysis Using Excel Functions
Dataset Overview
The dataset includes sales transaction records with the following columns:

Date: The transaction date.
Region: The sales region (e.g., West, Midwest, North).
Sales Rep: The salesperson responsible for the transaction.
Customer: The name of the customer or company purchasing the product.
Product: The item sold in the transaction.
COGS (Cost of Goods Sold): The cost incurred by the company for the goods sold.
Sales: The revenue generated from the transaction.
Excel Functions Used
To analyze this dataset effectively, I utilized several Excel functions for advanced data processing and insights extraction:

SUMIF and SUMIFS: To calculate total sales for specific regions or sales reps.
AVERAGEIF and AVERAGEIFS: To find the average sales or COGS for specific conditions.
VLOOKUP: For quickly referencing product details based on the product name.
COUNTIF: To count transactions per region, salesperson, or product.
IF and Nested IFs: For conditional logic to identify high-profit transactions or specific thresholds.
Example Insights
Total Sales by Region: A breakdown of sales performance across regions.
Top-Performing Sales Rep: Identification of the salesperson with the highest sales.
Product Profitability: Analysis of profit margins by comparing COGS and Sales.
Project Outcome
By leveraging Excel's advanced functions, I was able to automate key parts of the analysis process, make the data more interpretable, and derive actionable insights from the transactions dataset. This approach can be adapted for similar datasets in future projects.
